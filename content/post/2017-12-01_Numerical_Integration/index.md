Numerical integration for FTIR spectra in R

Numerical integration in R by fitting a piece-wise linear function. Example adapted from quoted sources. Firstly piece-wise linear function is fitted by `approxfun`, then integration is done by function `integrate` over the original limits of x. Secondly smooth spline is tested (with the function `splinefun`). Finally both solution are visually compared (spline fit is shifted up for clarity) - see figure below:

# fit a piece-wise linear function
fx.linear <- approxfun(x $wavenumber, x$intensity)
# integrate this function, over the original limits of x
Fx.linear <- integrate(fx.linear, min(x $wavenumber), max( x$wavenumber))
# fit a smooth spline, and return a function describing it
fx.spline <- splinefun(x $wavenumber, x$intensity)
# integrate this function, over the original limits of x
Fx.spline <- integrate(fx.spline, min(x $wavenumber), max( x$wavenumber))
