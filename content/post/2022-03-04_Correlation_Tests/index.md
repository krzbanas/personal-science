Correlation is a statistical method used to assess a possible association between two numeric variables, X and Y. 
There are several statistical coefficients that we can use to quantify correlation depending on the underlying relation of the data:

- Pearson’s 
- Spearman’s and Kendall’s
- Coefficient Eta
