Spatial moments are a very simple and powerful way to describe the spatial distribution of values, provided they have a sufficiently strong central tendency, that is, a tendency to cluster around some particular value. This implies that "background" pixel values (e.g. zones where the quantity of interest, such as intensity or concentration, is zero), are small. 

## Interpretation of spatial moments

* order 0 = TOTAL MASS [units: concentration, density, etc.]
* order 1 = location of CENTRE OF MASS in x and y from 0,0 [units: L]
* order 2 = VARIANCE around centroid in x and y [units: L^2]
* order 3 = coeff. of SKEWNESS (symmetry) in x and y [units: n/a]
--> =0 : SYMMETRIC distribution
--> <0 : Distribution asymmetric to the LEFT
(tail extends left of centre of mass)
--> >0 : Distribution asymmetric to the RIGHT
(tail extends right of centre of mass)
* order 4 = KURTOSIS (flatness) in x and y [units: n/a]
--> =0 : Gaussian (NORMAL) distribution
--> <0 : Distribution FLATTER than normal
--> >0 : Distribution MORE PEAKED than normal
--> <-1.2: BIMODAL (or multimodal) distribution

## Parameters derived from 2nd moments (from *Applied Image Processing* Awcock (1995))

* ELONGATION (ECCENTRICITY) = Ratio of longest to shortest
distance vectors from the object's centroid to its boundaries
* ORIENTATION = For elongated objects, describes the
orientation (in degrees) of the "long" direction with
respect to horizontal (x axis)
