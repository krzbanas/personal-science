Here is an example of performing a two-sample t-test in R and interpreting the results.

Suppose we want to test whether the mean height of men is significantly different from the mean height of women. We have two samples: one of heights of 50 men and one of heights of 50 women. We can use a two-sample t-test to test whether the difference between the sample means is statistically significant.

```r
# Generate fake data
set.seed(123)
men_heights <- rnorm(50, mean = 175, sd = 7)
women_heights <- rnorm(50, mean = 162, sd = 6)

# Perform two-sample t-test
t_test <- t.test(men_heights, women_heights)

# Print results
t_test
```
