Here is an example of performing a two-sample t-test in R and interpreting the results.

Suppose we want to test whether the mean height of men is significantly different from the mean height of women. We have two samples: one of heights of 50 men and one of heights of 50 women. We can use a two-sample t-test to test whether the difference between the sample means is statistically significant.

```r
# Generate fake data
set.seed(123)
men_heights <- rnorm(50, mean = 175, sd = 7)
women_heights <- rnorm(50, mean = 162, sd = 6)

# Perform two-sample t-test
t_test <- t.test(men_heights, women_heights)

# Print results
t_test
```

The output of the `t.test()` function provides a lot of information, including the sample means, the test statistic, the degrees of freedom, the p-value, and confidence intervals:

```yaml
Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  men_heights and women_heights
t = 16.563, df = 97.842, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 12.35252 14.92231
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 174.5499  162.0828 
```
