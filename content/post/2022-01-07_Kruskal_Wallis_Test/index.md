The Kruskal-Wallis test is a rank-based non-parametric alternative to the one-way ANOVA and an extension of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test to allow the comparison of more than two independent groups. Itâ€™s usually recommended when the assumptions of one-way ANOVA test are not met (non-normal distributions) or with small samples.
