One of the packages dealing with colours in R is `RColorBrewer`. With function `display.brewer.all` you can check the names of all palettes available in this packages. Function `colorRampPalette` is used to map desired number of colours or shades from a given palette.
Another way to use colours is to define your own palette (character vector with names or, like in this case hex numbers - do not forget # symbol). Colours defined in this way can be displayed as bar plot with `barplot` function.

```r
library("RColorBrewer")
display.brewer.all()
```

```r
#palette with 10 shades of Reds
colors06 <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(6, "Reds"))
barplot(c(1:4), col=colors06(10))
```

```r
#palette with 37 colours
colors37 = c("#466791","#60bf37","#953ada","#4fbe6c","#ce49d3","#a7b43d","#5a51dc","#d49f36","#552095","#507f2d","#db37aa","#84b67c","#a06fda","#df462a","#5b83db","#c76c2d","#4f49a3","#82702d","#dd6bbb","#334c22","#d83979",
