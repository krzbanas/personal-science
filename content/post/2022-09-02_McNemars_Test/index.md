The McNemar’s test (also known as the paired or matched chi-square) is used to determine if there are differences on a dichotomous dependent variable between two related groups. It can be considered to be similar to the paired-samples t-test, but for a dichotomous rather than a continuous dependent variable. The McNemar’s test is used to analyze pretest-posttest study designs (observing categorical outcomes more than once in the same patient), as well as being commonly employed in analyzing matched pairs and case-control studies.
