Group names extracted from filenames as factors

Short fix for proper label on plots for group names extrated from filenames (with `substr` function). It is done with `factor` function that labels the levels of factors.

```r
explosive<-substr(files, 1, 4)
explosive<-factor(explosive, levels=c ("C_4_", "PETN", "RDX_", "TNT_"), labels=c ("C-4", "PETN","RDX", "TNT"))
d1 = data.frame(files, explosive)
#create hyperSpec object
a1= new ("hyperSpec", wavelength = wavenumber, spc = spc, data=d1)
a1
```
