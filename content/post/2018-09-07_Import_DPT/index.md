Importing data point table file from Bruker Opus with `read.table` function. x and y coordinates are added with basic `rep` and `seq` functions. In this example pixel size is equal 2.7 \\( \mu m^2\\).

```r
file <- read.table ("6m_600_256scans_03.dpt", header = FALSE, dec = ".",
                    sep = ",")
# Single shot FTIR map has 64 by 64 spectra, pixel size is equal 2.7
# by 2.7 microns
# number of rows
x1 = 64
# number of colums 
y1 = 64 
x = rep (seq(from=0, to=2.7*(y1-1), by=2.7), times=x1)
y = rep (seq(from=0, to=2.7*(x1-1), by=2.7), each=y1)
d = data.frame(x,y)
# defining hyperSpec object
map01 <- new ("hyperSpec", wavelength = file [,1], spc = t (file [, -1]),
              data = d,label = list(.wavelength = "Wavenumber /cm-1",spc = "I / a.u."))
#check
map01
```
