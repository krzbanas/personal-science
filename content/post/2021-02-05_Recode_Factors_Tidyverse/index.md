To recode the factors in R with modified names and order, you can use the `forcats` package within the tidyverse framework. Here is an example:

```r

library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)

# create an example data frame with a factor column
df <- data.frame(
  x = factor(c("A", "B", "C", "A", "B")),
  y = 1:5
)

# create a new order for the factor levels
new_order <- c("C", "B", "A")

# create a mapping of old factor levels to new factor levels
level_mapping <- c("A" = "Alpha", "B" = "Beta", "C" = "Charlie")

# use fct_recode() to recode the factor levels with new names and order
df_new <- df %>%
  mutate(x = fct_recode(x, !!!level_mapping, .ordered = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(x = fct_relevel(x, new_order))

# print the new data frame
print(df_new)

```

This code will recode the factor levels in column x with the new names specified in `level_mapping`, and will order them as specified in `new_order`. The `fct_recode()` function is used to create a mapping between the old and new factor levels, and the `!!!` operator is used to unpack the mapping as separate arguments. The `.ordered = TRUE` argument is used to preserve the order of the factor levels. Finally, the `fct_relevel()` function is used to reorder the factor levels according to `new_order`.
