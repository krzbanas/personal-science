abstract = "The stratum corneum (SC) forms the outermost layer of the skin, playing a critical role in preventing water loss and protecting against external biological and chemical threats. Approximately 90% of the SC consists of large, flat corneocytes, yet its barrier function primarily relies on the intercellular lipid matrix that surrounds these cells. Traditional methods for characterizing these lipids, such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), typically involve macroscopic analysis using attenuated total reflection (ATR) techniques. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for investigating SC samples at a microscopic level to gain detailed chemical insights and assess sample heterogeneity. Special emphasis is placed on advanced hyperspectral data pre-processing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. We also evaluate methods for filtering out spectral data that significantly deviate from the mean and analyze the extracted mean spectra, the intensities of specific infrared peaks, and their ratios. The novelty of this work lies in its microscopic approach to analyzing the SC lipid matrix, diverging from the traditional macroscopic FTIR–ATR methods. By focusing on hyperspectral imaging and developing robust pre-processing techniques, this study provides more localized, high-resolution chemical insights. This microscopic perspective opens up the possibility of detecting subtle heterogeneities within the skin’s lipid matrix, offering deeper, previously unattainable understanding of the SC’s barrier function. Additionally, the exploration of spectral filtering methods enhances the precision of the analysis, paving the way for more refined and reliable investigations of skin structure and behavior in future research."
