abstract = "In this work we discuss how different accelerator-based techniques can be employed synergistically in order to provide a powerful analytical tool for forensic studies of foodstuff. To that end, a Brazilian coffee was chosen as a showcase due to its popularity and potential risk of adulteration and/or falsification. A comprehensive characterization through major and trace element analysis combined with age of production and compound contents was achieved. Different techniques like PIXE (Particle-Induced X-ray Emission), FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) and AMS- 14 C (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry â€“ Radiocarbon Analysis) were employed in the experiments. While PIXE provides information on the elements present in the samples, FTIR can probe compounds through their vibrational spectra. Finally, AMS- 14 C is capable of dating organic samples regarding their harvesting time. In this research, 5 different laboratories from research institutions around the world took part in the experiments.The integration of the results obtained with different techniques provided multifaceted perspectives on the coffee under study, thus allowing a direct assessment of the material for forensic purposes such as authentication, determination of provenance and combat counterfeiting."
