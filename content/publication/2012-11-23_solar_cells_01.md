abstract = "Multicrystalline silicon wafer solar cells reveal performance- reducing defects by luminescence. X-ray fluorescence spectra are used to investigate the elemental constituents from regions of solar cells yielding reverse-bias or sub-bandgap luminescence from defects. It is found that a higher concentration of metals is present in regions yielding reverse-bias electroluminescence than in regions yielding sub-bandgap electroluminescence. This suggests, dislocations do not create strong breakdown currents in the absence of impurity precipitates."
